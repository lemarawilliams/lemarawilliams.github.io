Hi! I'm Lemara Williams - an engineer and researcher committed to bridging the gap between technology and daily life. My current focus lies somewhere between visualization, decision-making and explainability.

When I'm more than an arm's length from a screen, you'll find me reading about a fantasy world or morally dubious charcters, making some tea, or trying to learn a new language. 

In my research, I aim to make the world a little easier to understand â€” and a lot easier to change.
